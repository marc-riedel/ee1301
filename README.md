## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic algebra and trigonometry
- No prior programming experience required

### Software Requirements
- C++ compiler (GCC, Visual Studio, or similar)
- Particle CLI or Particle Workbench (for embedded examples)
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)

### Hardware Requirements (for lab work)
- Particle Photon/Argon development board
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Basic electronic components (resistors, LEDs, sensors)
- Multimeter

## Learning Path

1. **Start with Lecture Notes**: Begin with [Lecture 1](./lecture-notes/lecture01_introduction.md) for course overview
2. **Practice Programming**: Work through C++ samples in order of complexity
3. **Hands-on Projects**: Build the Particle.io embedded system examples
4. **Apply Knowledge**: Complete laboratory exercises and assignments

## Usage Instructions

### Running C++ Examples
```bash
# Compile and run a C++ program
g++ -o power_calculator cpp-samples/power_calculator.cpp
./power_calculator
```

### Working with Particle Examples
1. Install Particle CLI: `npm install -g particle-cli`
2. Login to your Particle account: `particle login`
3. Flash code to device: `particle flash [device_name] particle-samples/led_blink.ino`
